The real issue with very widespread AI adoption in tech I think will always be that we need a way to drive down the cost."
7031,2020,12,2020-12-26 21:39:49+00:00,"@kentcdodds @DavidKPiano not saying that cars can't navigate, or that the tech isn't advancing.

but I don't see self-driving cars replacing human driving the way a lot of enthusiasts say it will."
7032,2020,12,2020-12-26 21:36:30+00:00,"@DavidKPiano @kentcdodds fwiw, I personally am very skeptical of any kind of ""AI-driven development"" discussion.

I see it as the equivalent of ""flying cars"" (or even ""self-driving cars"").. We're still driving basically the same cars, by hand, that we were 70 years ago.

fancier, safer, but same thing."
